        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate observational astrophysicist with advanced degrees in physics and strong technical skills in instrumentation, data analysis, and programming. I have contributed to multiple astrophotography, variability studies, and data processing projects. My current work involves using platforms like Slooh, AAVSO, and Lasair to explore transient phenomena and variability in stars and exoplanets.

        <h3>Anomaly Detection and Bayesian Analysis of Algol, TCrB, and Nebula Variability</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Ongoing Project, ASG Glasgow</strong><br>
            Leading an observational study of Algol (Beta Persei) and TCrB (T Coronae Borealis) using binoculars and a 16-inch dome telescope to monitor photometric variability and structural changes. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing photometric data collection and preprocessing for Algol, TCrB, and nebula observations.</li>
            <li>Generating high-precision light curves and emission maps using advanced tools.</li>
            <li>Applying Bayesian statistical models to detect outliers, periodic changes, and transient anomalies in light curves and nebula structures.</li>
            <li>Analysing variability mechanisms and structural evolution in binary star systems, recurrent novae, and diffuse nebulae.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Preparing a comprehensive report for submission to the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), emphasising the innovative use of Bayesian methods for astrophysical anomaly detection.
        </p>

        <h3>Transit Method for Exoplanets and Machine Learning with EXOTIC Framework</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Training Project, ASG Glasgow</strong><br>
            Conducted photometry, light curve generation, and error analysis. This project focuses on plate solving, photometry, spectroscopy, and light curve analysis using Astropy, Photutils, and SciPy.
        </p>

        <h3>All Sky Camera Sensor</h3>
        <p>
            Developed a system to calibrate IDS cameras against Trios sensors. Configured camera properties, analysed RGB spectra, and visualised results to reflect six orders of magnitude. Utilised Python for linearity fitting and comparative analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Star Measurement Analyser</h3>
        <p>
            Created a Python tool to calculate star distances. Leveraged Astropy for accurate calculations and visualised star positions using Matplotlib.
        </p>

        <h3>Fresnel Reflection (Thin Film)</h3>
        <p>
            Conducted experiments on light reflection at the interface of two media. Measured reflectivity of thin films and visualised results using Jupyter Notebooks.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Astronomy Society Glasgow (2023-present)</h3>
        <p>
            Operated telescopes and advanced equipment for imaging. Processed astrophotography data using PixInsight, AstroImageJ, and SiriL. Contributed to pulsar variability studies by applying advanced data analysis techniques.
        </p>
        <h3>Slooh Telescope Imaging and Reporting to AAVSO</h3>
        <p>
            Conducted imaging and data collection using Slooh telescopes. Reported variability findings to AAVSO, enhancing expertise in large dataset management and pulsar timing.
        </p>
        <h3>Lasair Platform (2024-present)</h3>
        <p>
            Recently joined Lasair, exploring transient phenomena and utilising APIs to manage and analyse astronomical data. Developing machine learning workflows for alert classification.
