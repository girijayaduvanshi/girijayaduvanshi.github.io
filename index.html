    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated researcher, the explorer, an independent astrophysicist with a passion for transient science, exoplanet detection, and astronomical variability studies. My work bridges observational astronomy and computational techniques, grounded in a strong foundation of instrumentation, data analysis, and Python programming. Currently, my focus includes studying transient phenomena such as supernovae, binary star variability, and emission nebulae while leveraging advanced statistical tools and machine learning techniques to refine light curve analysis and detect anomalies. Beyond transient science, I am deeply interested in exploring other astrophysical phenomena, including star-forming regions, galaxies, and high-energy sources, and aspire to contribute to large-scale surveys like LSST and ZTF.
    </p>
    <p>
        My collaborations with organisations such as the <a href="https://www.aavso.org/" target="_blank">AAVSO</a> and the <a href="https://app.slooh.com" target="_blank">Slooh Telescope Network</a> have strengthened my expertise in photometric calibration, FITS image processing, and real-time observation planning. Through these platforms, I have conducted structured observational studies, captured and analysed celestial images, and contributed to variability research of nebulae, galaxies, and stars. Additionally, I recently join the <a href="https://lasair.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html" target="_blank">Lasair platform</a> expecting to deepen my engagement with transient alert systems, enabling me to analyse real-time alerts, run custom code streams, and integrate SQL-based workflows for alert classification. As a council member of the <a href="https://www.theasg.org.uk/index.php/homepage" target="_blank">Astronomy Society Glasgow (ASG)</a>, I involve in public outreach initiatives and coordinate imaging projects to foster collaborative research in observational astronomy.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic pursuits focus on understanding the variability mechanisms in binary star systems, exoplanets, and supernovae while also investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies and nebulae. I am particularly drawn to leveraging machine learning and advanced computational techniques to expand our understanding of these systems. While my current focus is on transient science, I am eager to diversify my expertise and explore other astrophysical phenomena[Over next 30-35years], contributing to both small-scale observational studies and large-scale astronomical surveys. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a holistic understanding of the cosmos while inspiring and mentoring the next generation of astronomers.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Anomaly Detection and Bayesian Analysis of Algol, TCrB, and Nebula Variability(Ongoing)</h3>
        <p>
        This ongoing project focuses on monitoring the photometric variability and structural changes in celestial objects such as Algol (Beta Persei) and TCrB (T Coronae Borealis). Using binoculars and a 16-inch dome telescope, I aim to study variability mechanisms in binary star systems, recurrent novae, and nebulae. By employing Bayesian statistical models, the project identifies and quantifies anomalies, periodic changes, and transient phenomena in light curves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key work of this project include:
        <ul>
            <li>Generating high-precision light curves and emission maps with advanced photometric tools.</li>

            <li>Contributing insights into the evolution of binary systems and diffuse nebulae structures.</li>
        </ul>
        This work will culminate in a detailed report to be submitted to the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).
    </p>

    <h3>Transit Method for Exoplanets and Machine Learning with EXOTIC Framework(Ongoing)</h3>
    <p>
        In this project, I focus on refining transit detection techniques for exoplanets using the EXOTIC framework.
