    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated researcher, the explorer, an independent astrophysicist with a passion for transient science, exoplanet detection, and astronomical variability studies. My work bridges observational astronomy and computational techniques, grounded in a strong foundation of instrumentation, data analysis, and Python programming. Currently, my focus includes studying transient phenomena such as supernovae, binary star variability, and emission nebulae while leveraging advanced statistical tools and machine learning techniques to refine light curve analysis and detect anomalies. Beyond transient science, I am deeply interested in exploring other astrophysical phenomena, including star-forming regions, galaxies, and high-energy sources, and aspire to contribute to large-scale surveys like LSST and ZTF.
    </p>
    <p>
        My collaborations with organisations such as the <a href="https://www.aavso.org/" target="_blank">AAVSO</a> and the <a href="https://app.slooh.com" target="_blank">Slooh Telescope Network</a> have strengthened my expertise in photometric calibration, FITS image processing, and real-time observation planning. Through these platforms, I have conducted structured observational studies, captured and analysed celestial images, and contributed to variability research of nebulae, galaxies, and stars. Additionally, I recently join the <a href="https://lasair.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html" target="_blank">Lasair platform</a> expecting to deepen my engagement with transient alert systems, enabling me to analyse real-time alerts, run custom code streams, and integrate SQL-based workflows for alert classification. As an active member of the <a href="https://www.theasg.org.uk/index.php/homepage" target="_blank">Astronomy Society Glasgow (ASG)</a>, I involve in public outreach initiatives and coordinate imaging projects to foster collaborative research in observational astronomy.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic pursuits focus on understanding the variability mechanisms in binary star systems, exoplanets, and supernovae while also investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies and nebulae. I am particularly drawn to leveraging machine learning and advanced computational techniques to expand our understanding of these systems. While my current focus is on transient science, I am eager to diversify my expertise and explore other astrophysical phenomena[Over next 30-35years], contributing to both small-scale observational studies and large-scale astronomical surveys. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a holistic understanding of the cosmos while inspiring and mentoring the next generation of astronomers.

        <h3>Launching the NGC 3918 AAVSO Campaign</h3>
        <p><strong>Published on:</strong> <span class="blog-date">April 2025</span></p>
        <p>
            I'm thrilled to announce the launch of a global observing campaign on the planetary nebula NGC 3918, in collaboration with the AAVSO community. This initiative invites observers—especially in the southern hemisphere—to contribute narrowband and broadband photometric data to study long-term variability in the nebular structure and central star activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The campaign supports both FITS uploads and reduced magnitude contributions, with contributors eligible for co-authorship. If you'd like to take part or learn more, read the full details below.

        <h3>Nebulae Studies: Understanding Expansion and Variability</h3>
        <p><strong>Published on:</strong> <span class="blog-date">February 2025</span></p>
        <p>
            Planetary nebulae represent the final stages of stellar evolution for low to intermediate-mass stars.
            Their expansion rates provide insights into the underlying physics governing mass ejection, ionisation,
            and nebular evolution. This post explores the variability of <strong>NGC 3918</strong>, comparing archival
            data from **Hubble Space Telescope (HST)** and ground-based imaging to analyse changes in structure.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>1️⃣ Anomaly Detection and Bayesian Analysis of Algol, T CrB, and Nebular Variability</h3>
        <p>
            This long-term research project explores photometric variability and structural changes in systems such as Algol (Beta Persei), T CrB (T Coronae Borealis), and bright planetary nebulae. Using advanced light curve modeling, I apply Bayesian methods to detect anomalies, periodic signals, and transient behavior across variable stars and emission regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Observations have been conducted using binoculars, CCD imaging setups, and a 16-inch dome telescope as part of a broader independent survey. Insights from this project directly led to the development of a live monitoring campaign for one of the most photometrically interesting nebulae in the southern sky: NGC 3918.
        </p>

        <h3>NGC 3918 Planetary Nebula & AI-Powered Anomaly Detection (Ongoing)</h3>
        <p>
            This research project examines NGC 3918 not only as a photometric object of interest but as a model of dynamic evolution. The nebula's expansion and structure offer insight into asymmetry, variability, and stellar remnant formation—akin to observing galaxy-scale events on a microcosmic level.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are building an automated Python-based pipeline that processes photometric and imaging datasets from HST, AAVSO, MAST, and community observatories. The pipeline incorporates Bayesian modeling and anomaly detection using isolation forests and CNN architectures to flag time-domain variability and evolving morphology.

        </p>  

        <h3>2️⃣ Transit Method for Exoplanets and Machine Learning with EXOTIC Framework(Ongoing)</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I focus on refining transit detection techniques for exoplanets using the EXOTIC framework. The study includes plate solving, photometric error analysis, and light curve modeling with Astropy, Photutils, and SciPy. Machine learning algorithms are also explored to reduce noise and enhance the detection of planetary transits in noisy datasets.
        </p>
    <p>
        Expected key achievements:
        <ul>
            <li>Developing scalable workflows for light curve generation, essential for handling large datasets like those from LSST.</li>
            <li>Testing and comparing ML techniques such as anomaly detection and regression for improving transit models.</li>
            <li>Building a pipeline for transit characterisation that can be applied to upcoming surveys like ZTF and LSST.</li>
        </ul>
        This work exemplifies my ability to combine traditional photometry with cutting-edge computational tools to solve modern astronomical challenges.
    </p>

    <h3>3️⃣ Slooh Telescope Imaging</h3>
    <p>
        As a regular user of the Slooh Telescope network, I have captured and processed celestial images, including the Eta Carina and De Marian Nebulae. This project emphasises the study of variability in nebulae and star-forming regions through imaging and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using Slooh, I have been:
        <ul>
            <li>Capturing high-resolution images of celestial objects and processed them using Python, PixInsight and AstroImageJ.</li>
            <li>Conducting photometric analysis to understand the structure and variability of nebulae using Python/ML.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with international observers to report findings to the AAVSO for community contributions.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrated expertise in camera calibration and spectral analysis.</li>
            <li>Developed a robust workflow for comparing camera properties using Python.</li>
            <li>Published findings that improve small camera usage for scientific purposes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>5️⃣ Star Measurement Analyser</h3>
    <p>
        In this Python-based project, I developed a tool to calculate the distances of stars using Astropy. By incorporating catalog data and plotting star positions with Matplotlib, the project provided a reliable method for analysing stellar distances in observational astronomy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contributions include:
        <ul>
            <li>Building an efficient distance calculation algorithm for nearby stars.</li>
